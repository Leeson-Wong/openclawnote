Introduction

Coding AI Is the New Literacy
Today we take it for granted that many people know how to read and write. Someday, I hope,
it will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.
Several hundred years ago, society didn’t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small
number of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and
writing. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.
Words enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-tomachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication
becomes ever more important.
Traditional software engineering — writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences
of steps to execute — has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming
classes use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning,
and data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This
technology offers an even better pathway to coding.
Many Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman
behind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own
website software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).
But AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might
enable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant’s staffing and supply
chain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza — my favorite! — so he could make more
Hawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.
Uses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data. Thus,
a wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived
insights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding
even more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness
data to make their lives richer.
I hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic
traditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this
new form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.

Three Steps to
Career Growth

Three Steps to Career Growth

CHAPTER 1

The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting
careers in this field. A career is a decades-long journey, and the path is not straightforward.
Over many years, I’ve been privileged to see thousands of students, as well as engineers in
companies large and small, navigate careers in AI.
Here’s a framework for charting your own course.

Three key steps of career growth are learning foundational skills, working on projects (to
deepen your skills, build a portfolio, and create impact), and finding a job. These steps stack
on top of each other:

LEARNING

Initially, you

Three Steps to Career Growth

CHAPTER 1

These phases apply in a wide
range of professions, but AI
involves unique elements.
For example:
Learning foundational skills is a career-long process:

LEARNING

AI is nascent, and many technologies are still evolving. While the
foundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing —
and coursework is an efficient way to master them — beyond these
foundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more
important in AI than fields that are more mature.

Working on projects often means collaborating with
stakeholders who lack expertise in AI:

PROJECTS

This can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project’s
timeline and return on investment, and set expectations. In addition, the
highly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project
management: How can you come up with a plan for building a system
when you don’t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target
accuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may
be necessary to address post-deployment drift.

Inconsistent opinions on AI skills and jobs roles:

JOB

While searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in
other sectors, there are also important differences. Many companies are
still trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people
who have them. Things you’ve worked on may be significantly different
than anything your interviewer has seen, and you’re more likely to have to
educate potential employers about some elements of your work.

As you go through each step, you should also build a supportive community. Having friends and
allies who can help you — and who you strive to help — makes the path easier. This is true whether
you’re taking your first steps or you’ve been on the journey for years.

LEARNING

Learning Technical Skills For a Promising AI Career

CHAPTER 2

In the previous chapter, I introduced three key steps for building a career in AI: learning
foundational technical skills, working on projects, and finding a job, all of which is supported
by being part of a community. In this chapter, I’d like to dive more deeply into the first step:
learning foundational skills.
More research papers have been published on AI than anyone can read in a lifetime. So, when
learning, it’s critical to prioritize topic selection. I believe the most important topics for a technical
career in machine learning are:
Foundational machine learning skills: For example, it’s important to understand models such
as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly
detection. Beyond specific models, it’s even more important to understand the core concepts
behind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization,
optimization algorithms, and error analysis.
Deep learning: This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it’s hard to excel
in the field without some understanding of it! It’s valuable to know the basics of neural networks,
practical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks,
sequence models, and transformers.
Math relevant to machine learning: Key areas include linear algebra (vectors, matrices, and various
manipulations of them) as well as probability and statistics (including discrete and continuous
probability, standard probability distributions, basic rules such as independence and Bayes’ rule,
and hypothesis testing). In addition, exploratory data analysis (EDA) — using visualizations and other
methods to systematically explore a dataset — is an underrated skill. I’ve found EDA particularly
useful in data-centric AI development, where analyzing errors and gaining insights can really help
drive progress! Finally, a basic intuitive understanding of calculus will also help. The math needed
to do machine learning well has been changing. For instance, although some tasks require calculus,
improved automatic differentiation software makes it possible to invent and implement new neural
network architectures without doing any calculus. This was almost impossible a decade ago.
Software development: While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine
learning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software
to implement complex AI systems. These skills include programming fundamentals, data
structures (especially those that relate to machine learning, such as data frames), algorithms
(including those related to databases and data manipulation), software design, familiarity with
Python, and familiarity with key libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

Learning Technical Skills For a Promising AI Career

CHAPTER 2

This is a lot to learn!
Even after you master everything on this list, I hope you’ll keep learning and continue to deepen
your technical knowledge. I’ve known many machine learning engineers who benefitted from
deeper skills in an application area such as natural language processing or computer vision, or in
a technology area such as probabilistic graphical models or building scalable software systems.
How do you gain these skills? There’s a lot of good content on the internet, and in theory,
reading dozens of web pages could work. But when the goal is deep understanding, reading
disjointed web pages is inefficient because they tend to repeat each other, use inconsistent
terminology (which slows you down), vary in quality, and leave gaps. That’s why a good course
— in which a body of material has been organized into a coherent and logical form — is often the
most time-efficient way to master a meaningful body of knowledge. When you’ve absorbed the
knowledge available in courses, you can switch over to research papers and other resources.
Finally, no one can cram everything they need to know over a weekend or even a month. Everyone I
know who’s great at machine learning is a lifelong learner. Given how quickly our field is changing,
there’s little choice but to keep learning if you want to keep up.
How can you maintain a steady pace of learning for years? If you can cultivate the habit of
learning a little bit every week, you can make significant progress with what feels like less effort.

The Best Way to Build
a New Habit
One of my favorite books is BJ Fogg’s, Tiny Habits: The Small Changes That Change
Everything. Fogg explains that the best way to build a new habit is to start small
and succeed, rather than start too big and fail. For example, rather than trying to
exercise for 30 minutes a day, he recommends aspiring to do just one push-up, and
doing it consistently.
This approach may be helpful to those of you who want to spend more time studying.
If you start by holding yourself accountable for watching, say, 10 seconds of an
educational video every day — and you do so consistently — the habit of studying daily
will grow naturally. Even if you learn nothing in that 10 seconds, you’re establishing the
habit of studying a little every day. On some days, maybe you’ll end up studying for an
hour or longer.

CHAPTER 3

Should You
Learn Math to
Get a Job in AI?

LEARNING

Should you Learn Math to Get a Job in AI?

CHAPTER 3

How much math do you need to know to be a machine learning engineer?
Is math a foundational skill for AI? It’s always nice to know more math! But there’s so much to
learn that, realistically, it’s necessary to prioritize. Here’s how you might go about strengthening
your math background.
To figure out what’s important to know, I find it useful to ask what you need to know to make
the decisions required for the work you want to do. At DeepLearning.AI, we frequently ask,
“What does someone need to know to accomplish their goals?” The goal might be building a
machine learning model, architecting a system, or passing a job interview.
Understanding the math behind algorithms you use is often helpful, since it enables you to
debug them. But the depth of knowledge that’s useful changes over time. As machine learning
techniques mature and become more reliable and turnkey, they require less debugging, and a
shallower understanding of the math involved may be sufficient to make them work.
For instance, in an earlier era of machine learning, linear algebra libraries for solving linear
systems of equations (for linear regression) were immature. I had to understand how these
libraries worked so I could choose among different libraries and avoid numerical roundoff
pitfalls. But this became less important as numerical linear algebra libraries matured.
Deep learning is still an emerging technology, so when you train a neural network and the
optimization algorithm struggles to converge, understanding the math behind gradient
descent, momentum, and the Adam optimization algorithm will help you make better decisions.
Similarly, if your neural network does something funny — say, it makes bad predictions on
images of a certain resolution, but not others — understanding the math behind neural network
architectures puts you in a better position to figure out what to do.
Of course, I also encourage learning driven by curiosity. If something interests you, go ahead
and learn it regardless of how useful it might turn out to be! Maybe this will lead to a creative
spark or technical breakthrough.

CHAPTER 4

Scoping Successful
AI Projects

PROJECTS

Scoping Successful AI Projects

CHAPTER 4

One of the most important skills of an AI architect is the ability to identify ideas that are worth
working on. These next few chapters will discuss finding and working on projects so you can gain
experience and build your portfolio.
Over the years, I’ve had fun applying machine learning to manufacturing, healthcare, climate
change, agriculture, ecommerce, advertising, and other industries. How can someone who’s not
an expert in all these sectors find meaningful projects within them? Here are five steps to help
you scope projects.

Step 1

Identify a business problem (not an AI problem). I like to find
a domain expert and ask, “What are the top three things
that you wish worked better? Why aren’t they working yet?”
For example, if you want to apply AI to climate change, you
might discover that power-grid operators can’t accurately
predict how much power intermittent sources like wind
and solar might generate in the future.

Step 2
Brainstorm AI solutions. When I was younger, I used to
execute on the first idea I was excited about. Sometimes
this worked out okay, but sometimes I ended up missing
an even better idea that might not have taken any more
effort to build. Once you understand a problem, you can
brainstorm potential solutions more efficiently. For instance,
to predict power generation from intermittent sources, we
might consider using satellite imagery to map the locations
of wind turbines more accurately, using satellite imagery
to estimate the height and generation capacity of wind
turbines, or using weather data to better predict cloud cover
and thus solar irradiance. Sometimes there isn’t a good AI
solution, and that’s okay too.

Scoping Successful AI Projects

CHAPTER 4

Step 3

Assess the feasibility and value of potential solutions. You can determine
whether an approach is technically feasible by looking at published work,
what competitors have done, or perhaps building a quick proof of concept
implementation. You can determine its value by consulting with domain
experts (say, power-grid operators, who can advise on the utility of the
potential solutions mentioned above).

Step 4

Determine milestones. Once you’ve deemed a project sufficiently
valuable, the next step is to determine the metrics to aim for. This
includes both machine learning metrics (such as accuracy) and
business metrics (such as revenue). Machine learning teams are often
most comfortable with metrics that a learning algorithm can optimize.
But we may need to stretch outside our comfort zone to come up
with business metrics, such as those related to user engagement,
revenue, and so on. Unfortunately, not every business problem can be
reduced to optimizing test set accuracy! If you aren’t able to determine
reasonable milestones, it may be a sign that you need to learn more
about the problem. A quick proof of concept can help supply the
missing perspective.

Step 5

Budget for resources. Think through everything you’ll need to get the
project done including data, personnel, time, and any integrations or
support you may need from other teams. For example, if you need funds
to purchase satellite imagery, make sure that’s in the budget.

Working on projects is an iterative process. If, at any step, you find that the current direction is
infeasible, return to an earlier step and proceed with your new understanding. Is there a domain
that excites you where AI might make a difference? I hope these steps will guide you in exploring it
through project work — even if you don’t yet have deep expertise in that field. AI won’t solve every
problem, but as a community, let’s look for ways to make a positive impact wherever we can.
CHAPTER 5

Finding Projects that
Complement Your
Career Goals

PROJECTS

Finding Projects that Compliment Your Career Goals

CHAPTER 5

It goes without saying that we should only work on projects that are responsible, ethical, and
beneficial to people. But those limits leave a large variety to choose from. In the previous chapter,
I wrote about how to identify and scope AI projects. This chapter and the next have a slightly
different emphasis: picking and executing projects with an eye toward career development.
A fruitful career will include many projects, hopefully growing in scope, complexity, and impact
over time. Thus, it is fine to start small. Use early projects to learn and gradually step up to
bigger projects as your skills grow.
When you’re starting out, don’t expect others to hand great ideas or resources to you on a platter.
Many people start by working on small projects in their spare time. With initial successes — even
small ones — under your belt, your growing skills increase your ability to come up with better
ideas, and it becomes easier to persuade others to help you step up to bigger projects.

What if you don’t have any project ideas?
Here are a few ways to generate them:
✓

Join existing projects. If you find someone else with an idea, ask to join their project.

✓

Keep reading and talking to people. I come up with new ideas whenever I spend a lot of
time reading, taking courses, or talking with domain experts. I’m confident that you will, too.

✓

Focus on an application area. Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology
— say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language
models — so, while this is an exciting direction, it is also very hard. But the variety of
applications to which machine learning has not yet been applied is vast! I’m fortunate to
have been able to apply neural networks to everything from autonomous helicopter flight to
online advertising, partly because I jumped in when relatively few people were working on
those applications. If your company or school cares about a particular application, explore
the possibilities for machine learning. That can give you a first look at a potentially creative
application — one where you can do unique work — that no one else has done yet.

Finding Projects that Compliment Your Career Goals

✓

CHAPTER 5

Develop a side hustle. Even if you have a full-time job, a fun project that may or may not
develop into something bigger can stir the creative juices and strengthen bonds with
collaborators. When I was a full-time professor, working on online education wasn’t part of
my “job” (which was doing research and teaching classes). It was a fun hobby that I often
worked on out of passion for education. My early experiences in recording videos at home
helped me later in working on online education in a more substantive way. Silicon Valley
abounds with stories of startups that started as side projects. As long as it doesn’t create a
conflict with your employer, these projects can be a stepping stone to something significant.

Given a few project ideas, which one should you jump into?
Here’s a quick checklist of factors to consider:
✓

Will the project help you grow technically? Ideally, it should be challenging enough to
stretch your skills but not so hard that you have little chance of success. This will put you
on a path toward mastering ever-greater technical complexity.

✓

Do you have good teammates to work with? If not, are there people you can discuss things
with? We learn a lot from the people around us, and good collaborators will have a huge
impact on your growth.

✓

Can it be a stepping stone? If the project is successful, will its technical complexity and/
or business impact make it a meaningful stepping stone to larger projects? If the project
is bigger than those you’ve worked on before, there’s a good chance it could be such a
stepping stone.

Finally, avoid analysis paralysis. It doesn’t make sense to spend a month deciding whether to
work on a project that would take a week to complete. You'll work on multiple projects over
the course of your career, so you’ll have ample opportunity to refine your thinking on what’s
worthwhile. Given the huge number of possible AI projects, rather than the conventional “ready,
aim, fire” approach, you can accelerate your progress with “ready, fire, aim.”

Ready, Fire, Aim

Working on projects requires making tough choices about what to build and how to go
about it. Here are two distinct styles:
✓

Ready, Aim, Fire: Plan carefully and carry out careful validation. Commit and
execute only when you have a high degree of confidence in a direction.

✓

Ready, Fire, Aim: Jump into development and start executing. This allows you to
discover problems quickly and pivot along the way if necessary.

Say you’ve built a customer-service chatbot for retailers, and you think it could help restaurants,
too. Should you take time to study the restaurant market before starting development, moving
slowly but cutting the risk of wasting time and resources? Or jump in right away, moving
quickly and accepting a higher risk of pivoting or failing?
Both approaches have their advocates, and the best choice depends on the situation.
Ready, Aim, Fire tends to be superior when the cost of execution is high and a study can shed
light on how useful or valuable a project could be. For example, if you can brainstorm a few
other use cases (restaurants, airlines, telcos, and so on) and evaluate these cases to identify
the most promising one, it may be worth taking the extra time before committing to a direction.
Ready, Fire, Aim tends to be better if you can execute at low cost and, in doing so, determine
whether the direction is feasible and discover tweaks that will make it work. For example, if
you can build a prototype quickly to figure out if users want the product, and if canceling or
pivoting after a small amount of work is acceptable, then it makes sense to consider jumping
in quickly. When taking a shot is inexpensive, it also makes sense to take many shots. In this
case, the process is actually Ready, Fire, Aim, Fire, Aim, Fire, Aim, Fire.
After agreeing upon a project direction, when it comes to building a machine learning model
that’s part of the product, I have a bias toward Ready, Fire, Aim. Building models is an iterative
process. For many applications, the cost of training and conducting error analysis is not
prohibitive. Furthermore, it is very difficult to carry out a study that will shed light on the
appropriate model, data, and hyperparameters. So it makes sense to build an end-to-end
system quickly and revise it until it works well.
But when committing to a direction means making a costly investment or entering a oneway door (meaning a decision that’s hard to reverse), it’s often worth spending more time in
advance to make sure it really is a good idea.

PROJECTS

Building a Portfolio of Projects That Shows Skill Progression

CHAPTER 6

Over the course of a career, you’re likely to work on projects in succession, each growing in
scope and complexity. For example:

1. Class projects:
The first few projects might be narrowly scoped
homework assignments with predetermined right
answers. These are often great learning experiences!

2. Personal projects
You might go on to work on small-scale projects either alone or with friends.
For instance, you might re-implement a known algorithm, apply machine
learning to a hobby (such as predicting whether your favorite sports team
will win), or build a small but useful system at work in your spare time (such
as a machine learning-based script that helps a colleague automate some of
their work). Participating in competitions such as those organized by Kaggle
is also one way to gain experience.

3. Creating value
Eventually, you will gain enough skill to build projects in
which others see more tangible value. This opens the door
to more resources. For example, rather than developing
machine learning systems in your spare time, it might
become part of your job, and you might gain access to more
equipment, compute time, labeling budget, or head count.

4. Rising scope and complexity
Successes build on each other, opening the door to
more technical growth, more resources, and increasingly
significant project opportunities.

Building a Portfolio of Projects That Shows Skill Progression

CHAPTER 6

Each project is only one step on a longer journey, hopefully one that has a positive impact. In addition:
Don’t worry about starting too small. One of my first machine learning research projects involved
training a neural network to see how well it could mimic the sin(x) function. It wasn’t very useful, but
was a great learning experience that enabled me to move on to bigger projects.
Communication is key. You need to be able to explain your thinking if you want others to see
the value in your work and trust you with resources that you can invest in larger projects. To get
a project started, communicating the value of what you hope to build will help bring colleagues,
mentors, and managers onboard — and help them point out flaws in your reasoning. After you’ve
finished, the ability to explain clearly what you accomplished will help convince others to open the
door to larger projects.
Leadership isn’t just for managers. When you reach the point of working on larger AI projects that
require teamwork, your ability to lead projects will become more important, whether or not you are
in a formal position of leadership. Many of my friends have successfully pursued a technical rather
than managerial career, and their ability to help steer a project by applying deep technical insights
— for example, when to invest in a new technical architecture or collect more data of a certain type
— allowed them to grow as leaders and also helped significantly improve the project.

Building a portfolio of projects, especially one
that shows progress over time from simple to
complex undertakings, will be a big help when
it comes to looking for a job.

CHAPTER 7

A Simple Framework for Starting You AI Job Search

Finding a job has a few predictable steps that include selecting the companies to which you
want to apply, preparing for interviews, and finally picking a role and negotiating a salary and
benefits. In this chapter, I’d like to focus on a framework that’s useful for many job seekers in
AI, especially those who are entering AI from a different field.
If you’re considering your next job, ask yourself:
✓ Are you switching roles? For example, if you’re a software engineer,
university student, or physicist who’s looking to become a machine learning
engineer, that’s a role switch.
✓ Are you switching industries? For example, if you work for a healthcare
company, financial services company, or a government agency and want
to work for a software company, that’s a switch in industries.

A product manager at a tech startup who becomes a data scientist at the same company (or a
different one) has switched roles. A marketer at a manufacturing firm who becomes a marketer
in a tech company has switched industries. An analyst in a financial services company who
becomes a machine learning engineer in a tech company has switched both roles and industries.
If you’re looking for your first job in AI, you’ll probably find switching either roles or industries
easier than doing both at the same time. Let’s say you’re the analyst working in financial services:
✓ If you find a data science or machine learning job in financial services, you can continue
to use your domain-specific knowledge while gaining knowledge and expertise in AI. After
working in this role for a while, you’ll be better positioned to switch to a tech company (if
that’s still your goal).
✓ Alternatively, if you become an analyst in a tech company, you can continue to use your
skills as an analyst but apply them to a different industry. Being part of a tech company also
makes it much easier to learn from colleagues about practical challenges of AI, key skills to
be successful in AI, and so on.
If you’re considering a role switch, a startup can be an easier place to do it than a big company.
While there are exceptions, startups usually don’t have enough people to do all the desired
work. If you’re able to help with AI tasks — even if it’s not your official job — your work is likely
to be appreciated. This lays the groundwork for a possible role switch without needing to leave
the company. In contrast, in a big company, a rigid reward system is more likely to reward you
for doing your job well (and your manager for supporting you in doing the job for which you were
hired), but it’s not as likely to reward contributions outside your job’s scope.
After working for a while in your desired role and industry (for example, a machine learning
engineer in a tech company), you’ll have a good sense of the requirements for that role in that
industry at a more senior level. You’ll also have a network within that industry to help you along.
So future job searches — if you choose to stick with the role and industry — likely will be easier.
When changing jobs, you’re taking a step into the unknown, particularly if you’re switching either
roles or industries. One of the most underused tools for becoming more familiar with a new role
and/or industry is the informational interview. I’ll share more about that in the next chapter.
I’m grateful to Salwa Nur Muhammad, CEO of FourthBrain (a DeepLearning.AI affiliate), for providing
some of the ideas presented in this chapter.

Overcoming Uncertainty
There’s a lot we don’t know about the future: When will we cure Alzheimer’s disease? Who will
win the next election? Or, in a business context, how many customers will we have next year?
With so many changes going on in the world, many people are feeling stressed about the
future, especially when it comes to finding a job. I have a practice that helps me regain a sense
of control. Faced with uncertainty, I try to:

1

Make a list of plausible scenarios,
acknowledging that I don’t know
which will come to pass.

3

Start executing actions
that seem reasonable.

2

Create a plan of action
for each scenario.

4

Review scenarios and plans
periodically as the future
comes into focus.

For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic back in March 2020, I did this scenario planning
exercise. I imagined quick (three months), medium (one year), and slow (two years) recoveries
from Covid-19 and made plans for managing each case. These plans have helped me prioritize
where I can.
The same method can apply to personal life, too. If you’re not sure you’ll pass an exam, get a
job offer, or be granted a visa — all of which can be stressful — you can write out what you’d
do in each of the likely scenarios. Thinking through the possibilities and following through on
plans can help you navigate the future effectively no matter what it brings.

Bonus: With training in AI and statistics, you can calculate a probability for each scenario.
I’m a fan of the Superforecasting methodology, in which the judgments of many experts are
synthesized into a probability estimate.

Using Informational Interviews to Find the Right Job

CHAPTER 8

If you’re preparing to switch roles (say, taking a job as a machine learning engineer for the first
time) or industries (say, working in an AI tech company for the first time), there’s a lot about
your target job that you probably don’t know. A technique known as informational interviewing
is a great way to learn.
An informational interview involves finding someone in a company or role you’d like to know
more about and informally interviewing them about their work. Such conversations are separate
from searching for a job. In fact, it’s helpful to interview people who hold positions that align
with your interests well before you’re ready to kick off a job search.

✓ Informational interviews are particularly relevant to AI. Because the field is evolving, many
companies use job titles in inconsistent ways. In one company, data scientists might be
expected mainly to analyze business data and present conclusions on a slide deck. In
another, they might write and maintain production code. An informational interview can help
you sort out what the AI people in a particular company actually do.
✓ With the rapid expansion of opportunities in AI, many people will be taking on an AI job for
the first time. In this case, an informational interview can be invaluable for learning what
happens and what skills are needed to do the job well. For example, you can learn what
algorithms, deployment processes, and software stacks a particular company uses. You
may be surprised — if you’re not already familiar with the data-centric AI movement — to
learn how much time most machine learning engineers spend iteratively cleaning datasets.
Prepare for informational interviews by researching the interviewee and company in advance,
so you can arrive with thoughtful questions. You might ask:
✓ What do you do in a typical week or day?
✓ What are the most important tasks in this role?
✓ What skills are most important for success?
✓ How does your team work together to accomplish its goals?
✓ What is the hiring process?
✓ Considering candidates who stood out in the past, what enabled them to shine?

Using Informational Interviews to Find the Right Job

CHAPTER 8

Finding someone to interview isn’t always easy, but many people who are in senior positions today
received help when they were new from those who had entered the field ahead of them, and many
are eager to pay it forward. If you can reach out to someone who’s already in your network —
perhaps a friend who made the transition ahead of you or someone who attended the same school
as you — that’s great! Meetups such as Pie & AI can also help you build your network.
Finally, be polite and professional, and thank the people you’ve interviewed. And when you get
a chance, please pay it forward as well and help someone coming up after you. If you receive
a request for an informational interview from someone in the DeepLearning.AI community,
I hope you’ll lean in to help them take a step up! If you’re interested in learning more about
informational interviews, I recommend this article from the UC Berkeley Career Center.
I’ve mentioned a few times the importance of your network and community. People you’ve
met, beyond providing valuable information, can also play an invaluable role by referring you to
potential employers.

Finding the Right AI Job For You

CHAPTER 9

In this chapter, I’d like to
discuss some fine points
of finding a job.
The typical job search follows a fairly predictable path.
✓ Research roles and companies online or by talking to friends.
✓ Optionally, arrange informal informational interviews with people in companies that appeal to you.
✓ Either apply directly or, if you can, get a referral from someone on the inside.
✓ Interview with companies that give you an invitation.
✓ Receive one or more offers and pick one. Or, if you don’t receive an offer, ask for feedback
from the interviewers, human resources staff, online discussion boards, or anyone in your
network who can help you plot your next move.
Although the process may be familiar, every job search is different. Here are some tips to increase
the odds you’ll find a position that supports your thriving career and enables you to keep growing.
Pay attention to the fundamentals. A compelling resume, portfolio of technical projects, and
a strong interview performance will unlock doors. Even if you have a referral from someone in a
company, a resume and portfolio will be your first contact with many people who don’t already
know about you. Update your resume and make sure it clearly presents your education and
experience relevant to the role you want. Customize your communications with each company
to explain why you’re a good fit. Before an interview, ask the recruiter what to expect. Take time
to review and practice answers to common interview questions, brush up key skills, and study
technical materials to make sure they are fresh in your mind. Afterward, take notes to help you
remember what was said.
Proceed respectfully and responsibly. Approach interviews and offer negotiations with a winwin mindset. Outrage spreads faster than reasonableness on social media, so a story about
how an employer underpaid someone gets amplified, whereas stories about how an employer
treated someone fairly do not. The vast majority of employers are ethical and fair, so don’t let
stories about the small fraction of mistreated individuals sway your approach. If you’re leaving
a job, exit gracefully. Give your employer ample notice, give your full effort through your last
hour on the job, transition unfinished business as best you can, and leave in a way that honors
the responsibilities you were entrusted with.
Finding the Right AI Job For You

CHAPTER 9

Choose who to work with. It’s tempting to take a position because of the projects you’ll work
on. But the teammates you’ll work with are at least equally important. We’re influenced by
people around us, so your colleagues will make a big difference. For example, if your friends
smoke, the odds increase that you, too, will smoke. I don’t know of a study that shows this,
but I’m pretty sure that if most of your colleagues work hard, learn continuously, and build AI
to benefit all people, you’re likely to do the same. (By the way, some large companies won’t
tell you who your teammates will be until you’ve accepted an offer. In this case, be persistent
and keep pushing to identify and speak with potential teammates. Strict policies may make it
impossible to accommodate you, but in my mind, that increases the risk of accepting the offer,
as it increases the odds you’ll end up with a manager or teammates who aren’t a good fit.)
Get help from your community. Most of us go job hunting only a small number of times in our
careers, so few of us get much practice at doing it well. Collectively, though, people in your
immediate community probably have a lot of experience. Don’t be shy about calling on them.
Friends and associates can provide advice, share inside knowledge, and refer you to others
who may help. I got a lot of help from supportive friends and mentors when I applied for my
first faculty position, and many of the tips they gave me were very helpful.
I know that the job-search process can be intimidating. Instead of viewing it as a great leap,
consider an incremental approach. Start by identifying possible roles and conducting a handful
of informational interviews. If these conversations tell you that you have more learning to do
before you’re ready to apply, that’s great! At least you have a clear path forward. The most
important part of any journey is to take the first step, and that step can be a small one.

Keys to Building a Career in AI

CHAPTER 10

The path to career success in AI is more complex than what I can cover in one short eBook.
Hopefully the previous chapters will give you momentum to move forward.
Here are additional things to think about as you plot your path to success:

1. Teamwork:
When we tackle large projects, we succeed better by
working in teams than individually. The ability to collaborate
with, influence, and be influenced by others is critical.
Thus, interpersonal and communication skills really matter.
(I used to be a pretty bad communicator, by the way.)

2. Networking:
I hate networking! As an introvert, having to go to a party
to smile and shake as many hands as possible is an activity
that borders on horrific. I’d much rather stay home and read
a book. Nonetheless, I’m fortunate to have found many
genuine friends in AI; people I would gladly go to bat for
and who I count on as well. No person is an island, and
having a strong professional network can help propel you
forward in the moments when you need help or advice. In
lieu of networking, I’ve found it more helpful to think about
building up a community. So instead of trying to build up
my personal network, I focus instead on building up the
communities that I’m part of. This has the side effect of
helping me meet more people and make friends as well.

Keys to Building a Career in AI

CHAPTER 10

3. Job search
Of all the steps in building a career, this
one tends to receive the most attention.
Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad advice
about this on the internet. (For example, many
articles urge taking an adversarial attitude
toward potential employers, which I don’t think
is helpful.) Although it may seem like finding a
job is the ultimate goal, it’s just one small step
in the long journey of a career.

4. Personal discipline
Few people will know whether you spend
your weekends learning, or binge watching
TV — but they will notice the difference over
time. Many successful people develop good
habits in eating, exercise, sleep, personal
relationships, work, learning, and self-care.
Such habits help them move forward while
staying healthy.

5. Altruism
I find that people who aim to lift others during
every step of their own journey often achieve
better outcomes for themselves. How can we
help others even as we build an exciting career
for ourselves?

CHAPTER 11

Overcoming Imposter
Syndrome

Overcoming Imposter Syndrome

Before we dive into the final chapter of this book, I’d like to address the serious matter of
newcomers to AI sometimes experiencing imposter syndrome, where someone — regardless
of their success in the field — wonders if they’re a fraud and really belong in the AI community.
I want to make sure this doesn’t discourage you or anyone else from growing in AI.

Let me be clear: If you want to be part of the AI
community, then I welcome you with open arms.
If you want to join us, you fully belong with us!
An estimated 70 percent of people experience some form of imposter syndrome at some point.
Many talented people have spoken publicly about this experience, including former Facebook
COO Sheryl Sandberg, U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, actor Tom Hanks, and Atlassian co-CEO
Mike Cannon-Brookes. It happens in our community even among accomplished people. If you’ve
never experienced this yourself, that’s great! I hope you’ll join me in encouraging and welcoming
everyone who wants to join our community.
AI is technically complex, and it has its fair share of smart and highly capable people. But it is
easy to forget that to become good at anything, the first step is to suck at it. If you’ve succeeded
at sucking at AI — congratulations, you’re on your way!
I once struggled to understand the math behind linear regression. I was mystified when
logistic regression performed strangely on my data, and it took me days to find a bug in my
implementation of a basic neural network. Today, I still find many research papers challenging
to read, and I recently made an obvious mistake while tuning a neural network hyperparameter
(that fortunately a fellow engineer caught and fixed).
So if you, too, find parts of AI challenging, it’s okay. We’ve all been there. I guarantee that everyone
who has published a seminal AI paper struggled with similar technical challenges at some point.

Overcoming Imposter Syndrome

Here are some things that can help.
✓ Do you have supportive mentors or peers? If you don’t yet, attend Pie & AI or other events,
use discussion boards, and work on finding some. If your mentors or manager don’t support
your growth, find ones who do. I’m also working on how to grow a supportive AI community
and hope to make finding and giving support easier for everyone.
✓ No one is an expert at everything. Recognize what you do well. If what you do well is
understand and explain to your friends one-tenth of the articles in The Batch, then you’re
on your way! Let’s work on getting you to understand two-tenths of the articles.
My three-year-old daughter (who can barely count to 12) regularly tries to teach things to my
one-year-old son. No matter how far along you are — if you’re at least as knowledgeable as a
three-year-old — you can encourage and lift up others behind you. Doing so will help you, too,
as others behind you will recognize your expertise and also encourage you to keep developing.
When you invite others to join the AI community, which I hope you will do, it also reduces any
doubts that you are already one of us.
AI is such an important part of our world that I would like everyone who wants to be part of it
to feel at home as a member of our community. Let’s work together to make it happen.

Final Thoughts
Make Every Day Count
Every year on my birthday, I get to thinking about the days behind and those
that may lie ahead.
Maybe you’re good at math; I’m sure you’ll be able to answer the following question
via a quick calculation. But let me ask you a question, and please answer from
your gut, without calculating.

How many days is a
typical human lifespan?
20,000 days

100,000 days

1 million days

5 million days

When I ask friends, many choose a number in the hundreds of
thousands. (Many others can’t resist calculating the answer,
to my annoyance!)
When I was a grad student, I remember plugging my statistics
into a mortality calculator to figure out my life expectancy.
The calculator said I could expect to live a total of 27,649
days. It struck me how small this number is. I printed it in a
large font and pasted it on my office wall as a daily reminder.
That’s all the days we have to spend with loved ones, learn,
build for the future, and help others. Whatever you’re doing
today, is it worth 1/30,000 of your life?
